1. For the MS1 quantification algorithm to work properly, RAW files need to be converted to mzXML or MzML, with 64 bit encoding.

2. Philosopher only works with NCBI and UniProt databases or a database with headers formatted using the NCBI or [UniProt specification](http://www.uniprot.org/help/fasta-headers).
