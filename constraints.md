### Are there any constraints ?

One of the major source of problems using custom pipelines like Philosopher originates with badly formatted FASTA databases. Philosopher works with NCBI and UniProt databases or a database with headers formatted using the NCBI or [UniProt specification](http://www.uniprot.org/help/fasta-headers). If your FASTA file contains headers with different formatting we stringly suggest you to format them following the guidelines from one of the suggested online Databases mentioned above.
